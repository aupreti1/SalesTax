# SalesTax

This is a NODE console application that calculates the tax and prints a receipt for each input.

TOOLS USED:
* Node.js
* Mocha NPM
* Javascript


HOW IT WORKS:
* The first application assigns which items are exempt from taxes, if the item is imported or domestic and what the tax percentage is for each.
* I then created a function to loop through the array and calculate how much tax was applied to the input as a whole
* A third function was created to calculate the total of all the prices including the tax.
